# Acoustic Signal Analysis using FFT and STFT

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a structured signal processing workflow in Python to analyze recorded acoustic signals from human motion.

The analysis includes:
- Time-domain visualization
- Frequency-domain analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Time-frequency analysis using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

## 🎯 Objective
To extract and observe dominant frequency components and analyze spectral behavior over time. Moving body parts (torso, hands, feets) are also identified during human motion.

## 🛠 Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Time-Domain Signal Visualization
3. Frequency Analysis (FFT)
4. Time-Frequency Analysis (STFT)

## 📈 Results
- Clear dominant frequency peaks identified
- Spectrogram confirms signal stability
- Body parts clearly distinguishable
